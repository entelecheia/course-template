The **Course Template** project serves as a foundational blueprint for educators and content creators aiming to develop and disseminate programming and technology-focused educational materials. Leveraging the power of GitHub for version control and collaboration, this template ensures that course content is both accessible and maintainable. It includes predefined structures for course documentation, licensing, and changelogs, simplifying the process of course creation.

Key features of the template include:

- **Interactive Documentation:** Utilizes Jupyter Book to create interactive and engaging learning materials that can include live code, visualizations, and narratives.
- **Ease of Distribution:** With packaging for PyPI, the template facilitates the distribution of course materials and tools, making it easier for educators to reach a wider audience.
- **Open Contribution Model:** Encourages contributions from the community through clear guidelines, ensuring the course content remains up-to-date and inclusive of diverse perspectives.
- **Licensing:** Adopts the CC-BY-4.0 License, promoting open access and reuse of educational materials while ensuring creators are properly credited.
